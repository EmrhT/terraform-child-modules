# Terraform Child Modules
This module is a basic boilerplate for multi account, multi environment and multi resource deployments. It is based on Yevgeniy Brikman's repo --> https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code

## How to Use
Modules here are not directly usable but child modules. They are consumed by root modules here --> https://github.com/EmrhT/terraform-multiaccount-root-modules
